# SleepMonitoring_Prototype

Snooze is a sleep monitoring app, which collects the user's bedtime, wakeup time, and set the duration of user's sleep. After the confirmation user can actually connect with my app.

We all know that our sleep is directly connected with our health, our mind, our thinking, and our fitness. For better sleep, I presented a new thing that helps users to sleep well and improve their health. After setup all the timings, users will react at the app's most important page, where he/she can get in touch with Clam Sounds, Meditation, Exercises, Yoga, and other activities.

### Calm Sound & Meditation Part:

For any app or website, there is one thing that impacts too much which is #"User Consistency". For actively using this app I used a small game, doing these exercises, yoga, and all the things, users will get points for these activities. And there is a range of points after crossing that range user will be leveled up. 

### Range of Level: 1500 points = 1 Level
0 - 4,000 points mean #RED pointer. \
4,000 - 8,000 points mean #PURPLE pointer. \
8,000 - 12,000 points mean #GREEN pointer. \
12,000 - 16,000 points mean #YELLOW pointer. \
16,000 - 20,000 points mean #BLUE pointer.

After collecting points, 
#### Score 20,000 Points to redeem 1 coin.

The collection of coins will show in the "Coin Balance" section. User can View their transaction, Spend Coins, and see the Progress. Using these coins, users can order/purchase anything which is within range of their coins. \

From this app, users can connect with people, and make groups for their motivation. Also, add his/her friend. Edit profile, get info, notifications, all these minor sections are designed well.

For motivating users, there is another good section which is "Leaderboard".

## Summarize:
Snooze is an app prototype, which is created by me in my 4th semester. The idea behind this prototype is to encourage people to fit well and sleep well. For every UI, user consistency does a very big role. To cover this thing, I added a game section, because for doing anything everyone needs motivation/ a target/ a goal. By giving them ranking/points/coins/orders, the user interaction with my app, and the user consistency with my app will automatically increase.
