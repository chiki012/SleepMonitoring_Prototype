# SleepMonitoring_Prototype

Snooze is a sleep monitoring app, which collects the user's bedtime, wakeup time, and set the duration of user's sleep. After the confirmation user can actually connect with my app.

We all know that our sleep is directly connected with our health, our mind, our thinking, and our fitness. For better sleep, I presented a new thing that helps users to sleep well and improve their health. After setup all the timings, users will react at the app's most important page, where he/she can get in touch with Clam Sounds, Meditation, Exercises, Yoga, and other activities.
