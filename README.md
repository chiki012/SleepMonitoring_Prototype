# SleepMonitoring_Prototype

Snooze is a sleep monitoring app, which collects the user's bedtime, wakeup time, and set the duration of user's sleep. After the confirmation user can actually connect with my app.

We all know that our sleep is directly connected with our health, our mind, our thinking, and our fitness. For better sleep, I presented a new thing that helps users to sleep well and improve their health. After setup all the timings, users will react at the app's most important page, where he/she can get in touch with Clam Sounds, Meditation, Exercises, Yoga, and other activities.

For any app or website, there is one thing that impacts too much which is #"User Consistency". For actively using this app I used a small game, doing these exercises, yoga, and all the things, users will get points for these activities. And there is a range of points after crossing that range user will be leveled up. 

### Range of Level: 1500 points = 1 Level
0 - 4,000 points mean #RED pointer. 
4,000 - 8,000 points mean #PURPLE pointer. \
8,000 - 12,000 points mean #GREEN pointer.
12,000 - 16,000 points mean #YELLOW pointer.
16,000 - 20,000 points mean #BLUE pointer.
